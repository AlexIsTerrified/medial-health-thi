# Task Manager Application

This repository contains a Task Manager application built with React, TypeScript, and Material UI.

## Project Overview

This application allows users to create, edit, delete, and assign tasks. Each task includes fields for title, description, due date, assignee, priority level, notes, and status. The tasks are displayed in a table or list view.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Users can create new tasks with fields for title, description, due date, assignee, priority level, notes, and status. Tasks can be edited and deleted as needed.
- **Task Assignment**: Tasks can be assigned to other users.
- **In-Memory Storage**: Task data is stored in memory, with a list maintained within the state of the application/dashboard/main page.

## Bonus Features

- **Data Persistence**: Implemented data persistence using a nodeJS backend [./medial-health-backend] and local storage for offline data persistence.
- **Task Sorting and Filtering**: Added sorting and filtering options for the task list.
